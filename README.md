# micro_ros_espidf_component
Branch clear-idf-component shows my proposal for restructuring original repository for Micro-ROS esp idf component
https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_espidf_component

In new structure component files are on the root directory of repository.
Example application files are in the example\int32_publisher directory.

This new structure helps to use this repository as a component by cloning repository to 
components directory on the projects used.
